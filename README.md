## Project Overview

**Balancio** is a financial tracker application built as our **Capstone Project**. We designed it to help people take the stress out of money management by making it easy to log income, track spending, and see exactly where their money is going through custom reports.

Instead of a messy spreadsheet, Balancio gives you a structured way to keep your financial history organized and saved in one place.

## Features & Screens

Balancio provides the essential tools for insightful financial tracking:

* **Transaction Management:** Easily add, edit, and delete income and expense transactions.
* **Category-Based Tracking:** Transactions can be organized into categories (e.g., Groceries, Rent, Salary) for better analysis.
* **Financial Summary:** View a real-time summary of your current balance.

##### 🎮 How it Works: Navigating Balancio

Balancio is organized into three main screens to keep your workflow simple. Here is a breakdown of what you can do in each:

### 🏠 Home Screen
This is your starting point. From here, you can quickly log money coming in or going out.
* **[D] Add Deposit:** Log your income (Salary, Gifts, etc.).
* **[P] Make Payment:** Log your expenses (Rent, Groceries, etc.).
* **[L] Ledger:** Jump into your transaction history.
* **[X] Exit:** Safely close the application.

### 📒 Ledger Screen
The Ledger is your "Command Center" for viewing history. By default, it shows your newest transactions first.
* **[A] All:** See every single transaction in your history.
* **[D] Deposits:** Filter to see only your income.
* **[P] Payments:** Filter to see only your spending.
* **[R] Reports:** Move to the advanced analysis screen.
* **[H] Home:** Go back to the main menu.

### 📊 Reports Screen
This is where you get into the details. We built filters to help you see your habits over time.
* **Standard Reports:** Quickly pull data for **Month To Date**, **Previous Month**, **Year To Date**, or the **Previous Year**.
* **Search by Vendor:** Type in a name (like "Amazon") to see exactly how much you've spent there.
