## Project Overview

**Balancio** is a financial tracker application built as our **Capstone Project**. We designed it to help people take the stress out of money management by making it easy to log income, track spending, and see exactly where their money is going through custom reports.

Instead of a messy spreadsheet, Balancio gives you a structured way to keep your financial history organized and saved in one place.
